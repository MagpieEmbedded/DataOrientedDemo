This repository demonstrates performance differences between different implementations of a simple interpolation algorithm.

In order to compile the program, run 'make check' for an optimized build or 'make debug' for a debug build.

In order to run the program, call './check <number of models> <average number of animations per model> <number of repetitions>'. The program will create the models, interpolate them and verify that each implementation reached the same values, and then print the time each implementation took to complete.

PRs are welcome!
